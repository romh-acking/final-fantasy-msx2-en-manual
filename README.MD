# Final Fantasy MSX2: English Manual Translation

## About
This repository manual resources for an English translation of Final Fantasy for the MSX2. You can check out the original scans here:

[https://archive.org/details/FinalFantasy1989JP/](https://archive.org/details/FinalFantasy1989JP/)

The source code for the translation is located at [final-fantasy-msx2-en](https://github.com/romh-acking/final-fantasy-msx2-en).

At the time of this writing, there's a manual scan online, but the last few pages are missing. The table of contents reference a magic list, but it isn't included in the scan. Additionally, the staple alignment in the scan also corroborates there's pages missing in the scan.

Because the manual's terminology is based on the localization, it is not accurate. Therefore, I've included the raw translation here.
